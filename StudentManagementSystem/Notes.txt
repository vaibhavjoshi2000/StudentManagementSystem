---------------------------Points to remember-------------
1. What is a Generic?

=> Generic is a feature in C# that allows you to define a class, method, or data structure with a placeholder type.
   This means that the data type can be specified later when you create an instance of that class or method.
   It makes the code type-safe and reusable.

=> List<T> is a generic collection (a list) that can hold items of any type, where T is a placeholder 
   for the type of data the list will hold.

=> List<Student> means that this list will hold Student objects.

=> File Handling:

StreamWriter: Writes to a file.
StreamReader: Reads from a file.
File.Exists: Checks if the file exists before attempting to load it.
Comma-Separated Values (CSV):

The data is saved in a simple format where values are separated by commas.
This makes it easy to read and split the data later.
Clearing and Reloading:

students.Clear(): Ensures no duplicate data is loaded.
Adds new Student objects back to the list.
